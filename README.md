This Python script uses the **Turtle graphics module** to draw a heart shape. It defines two mathematical functions, `heart(t)` and `heart1(t)`,
to calculate the x and y coordinates of the heart based on sine and cosine equations. The `for` loop iterates 1000 times,
moving the turtle to calculated coordinates scaled by 20. The background is set to black, and the heart is drawn in light blue.
The `speed(10)` command ensures fast drawing, and the `done()` function keeps the window open to display the result.
